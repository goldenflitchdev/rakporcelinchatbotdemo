## 📋 Before You Test (Required Steps)

You need to complete **2 quick steps** before testing:

### Step 1: Configure Environment (2 minutes)

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local and add your OpenAI API key
# Replace 'sk-your-openai-api-key-here' with your actual key
```

**Get an OpenAI API key:** https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### Step 2: Index the Website (15-30 minutes)

```bash
# This crawls and indexes the RAK Porcelain website
npm run index
```

This step:
- Crawls rakporcelain.com/us-en
- Extracts content and creates embeddings
- Builds the knowledge base for the chatbot
- Only needs to be done once (or when you want to refresh content)

---

## 🚀 How to Test

Once you've completed the 2 steps above:

```bash
# Verify everything is set up correctly
npm run verify

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (You)
1. Add your OpenAI API key to `.env.local`
2. Run `npm run index` to build the knowledge base
3. Run `npm run verify` to check everything
4. Start testing with `npm run dev`

### Short-term (After Testing)
1. Test all scenarios in TESTING_GUIDE.md
2. Document any issues found
3. Optimize performance if needed
4. Prepare for production deployment

### Long-term (Production)
1. Set up hosting (Vercel recommended)
2. Configure production environment variables
3. Run indexer in production
4. Monitor usage and costs
5. Schedule regular re-indexing

## 💰 Cost Estimates

**Development/Testing:**
- Indexing: ~$2-5 (one-time, depending on website size)
- Per query: ~$0.01-0.02
- Testing (100 queries): ~$1-2

**Production:**
- Monthly costs depend on usage volume
- ~$0.01-0.02 per conversation turn
- Optimize by caching, limiting queries, etc.

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **First-time setup required** - Need to index website before use
2. **Static knowledge** - Need to re-index to get new content
3. **API dependency** - Requires OpenAI API access
4. **English only** - Currently configured for US English site
5. **Rate limits** - Subject to OpenAI API rate limits

## 🆘 Support

### If you encounter issues:

1. **Check documentation:**
   - README.md for general help
   - TESTING_GUIDE.md for testing issues
   - INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS.txt for setup

2. **Run verification:**
   ```bash
   npm run verify
   ```

3. **Check error messages:**
   - Browser console (F12)
   - Terminal running npm run dev
   - Network tab for API failures

4. **Common issues:**
   - "Database not initialized" → Run `npm run index`
